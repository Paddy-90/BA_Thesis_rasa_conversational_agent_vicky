      My main task is to identify your learning style. Also, you can ask me:

       - Where have the buttons gone?
       - What is a learning style?

       - Why is negation not possible?

  utter_learningstyle:
  - text: A learning style is a way in which you begin to concentrate on, process, absorb, and retain new and difficult information. The interaction of these elements occurs differently in everyone. Therefore, it is necessary to determine what is most likely to trigger your concentration, how to maintain it, and how to respond to your natural processing style to produce long-term memory and retention. I will try to identify your learning style during our conversation and a quiz game.
